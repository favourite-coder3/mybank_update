## Prerequisites

To compile and run MyBank, ensure that you have the following:

- C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with MyBank:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mybank.git
```

2. Compile the code using a C compiler:

```
gcc -o mybank mybank.c
```

3. Run the executable:

```
./mybank
```

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to create an account by entering your first and last names.

2. Enter your password. The program will validate the password by asking you to re-enter it. You have three attempts to enter the correct password.

3. Once your password is validated, you will be welcomed to MyBank, and your initial account balance of 50,000 will be displayed.

4. The following options are available in the menu:

   - **a. Transfer Money**: Transfer a specified amount from your account to another recipient's account. Enter the recipient's account name, account number, bank name, and the transfer amount. If the transfer amount exceeds your account balance, an insufficient balance message will be displayed.

   - **b. Deposit Money**: Deposit a specified amount into your account. Enter the deposit amount. If the deposit amount is invalid (less than or equal to zero), an error message will be displayed.

   - **c. Check Balance**: Check the current balance of your account.

   - **d. Quit the Program**: Exit the program.

5. After each transaction, a transaction receipt will be generated and saved in a file named "receipt.txt". The receipt contains details such as the transaction type, account name, account number, bank name, transaction amount, previous balance, current balance, and the date and time of the transaction.
